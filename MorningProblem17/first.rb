# Write a method that takes an array of names as an argument and returns a string of all of those names separated by commas. For instance, if I pass the array [“Chris”, “Oggi”, “Emily”] the method should return the string “Chris, Oggi, Emily”.
# Then write a method that takes a string as an argument. This method will use the returned value from the first method in order to construct a larger string. For instance, if I pass my second method the string “work here.” then the second method should return “Chris, Oggi, Emily work here.”
#  If you finish, make the method return the string with “and” before the last name. For instance: “Chris, Oggi, and Emily work here.”

# def array_name(array)
# 	array = ["chris", "oggi", "emily"]
# 	values = array.join(", ")
# 	values.each do |value|
